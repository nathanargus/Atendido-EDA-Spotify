### Overview of Dataset

In this section, we will address key questions regarding the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, the data types of each column, and any missing values present.

- How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?
- What are the data types of each column? Are there any missing values?

```python

# Display the number of rows and columns
rows, columns = df.shape
print(f"The dataset contains {rows} rows and {columns} columns.\n")

# Display the data types of each column with aligned formatting
data_types = df.dtypes

print("\nColumn Data Types:")
for column, dtype in data_types.items():
    print(f"{column:<30}: {dtype}")

# Check for any missing values in the dataset
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
missing_values = missing_values[missing_values > 0]

print("\nMissing Values in Each Column:")
for column, count in missing_values.items():
    print(f"{column:<30}: {count}")

```

### Genre and Music Characteristics

In this section, we will explore the relationships between the number of streams and various musical attributes, such as beats per minute (bpm), danceability percentage, and energy percentage. We will assess which of these attributes most significantly influences streaming numbers. Additionally, we will investigate the correlation between danceability and energy, as well as between valence and acousticness, to understand how these musical characteristics interact with each other. You can see the function and output below.

- Examine the correlation between streams and musical attributes like bpm, danceability_%, and energy_%. Which attributes seem to influence streams the most?
- Is there a correlation between danceability_% and energy_%? How about valence_% and acousticness_%?

```python

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df[['streams', 'bpm', 'danceability_%', 'energy_%', 'valence_%', 'acousticness_%', 'instrumentalness_%', 
                  'liveness_%','speechiness_%']].corr()

# Create a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, fmt='.3f', cmap='PiYG')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of Streams and Musical Attributes')
plt.show()

```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66346211-8b04-4480-995b-9fd63bbbb294)

#### Key Insights:

- __Influence of Musical Attributes on Streams__: The correlation between _streams_ and musical attributes such as *bpm, danceability_%*, and *energy_%* is weak. Specifically, *streams* has correlations of **-0.002** with *bpm*, **-0.105** with *danceability_%*, and **-0.026** with *energy_%*, indicating that these attributes individually have minimal influence on streaming popularity. This suggests that other external factors may be more influential in driving streams.
- **Correlation Between Danceability_% and Energy_%**: There is a positive correlation of **0.198** between *danceability_%* and *energy_%*. Although this correlation is moderate, it suggests that tracks with higher danceability tend to have higher energy, making them suitable for high-energy environments like clubs or workout playlists.
- **Correlation Between Valence_% and Acousticness_%**: The correlation between *valence_%* (mood positivity) and *acousticness_%* is very weak at **-0.082**. This indicates that there is no strong relationship between the mood of a track and its acoustic nature, suggesting that positive or negative moods can appear equally in both acoustic and non-acoustic tracks.

### Platform Popularity

In this section, we will analyze the popularity of tracks across different music streaming platforms: Spotify, Deezer, and Apple Music. By comparing the number of tracks listed on these platforms, we can identify trends in platform usage and determine which platform tends to feature the most popular tracks. This analysis will provide insights into user preferences and the distribution of music across these major streaming services. You can see the function and output below.

- How do the numbers of tracks in spotify_playlists, deezer_playlist, and apple_playlists compare? Which platform seems to favor the most popular tracks?
